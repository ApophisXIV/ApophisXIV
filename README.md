# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me tell you more about me ...

I'm Guido Rodriguez, an electronics technician with knowledge in embedded system development.  
Actually, I'm studying Electronics Engineer degree at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  
One of the projects I developed during my high school period that I'm proud of is a basic AHRS with GPS and Lora communication called Proyecto Piazzolla, inspired by the tango of Piazzola "Libertango". It was selected for a local science fair as one of the best projects. (https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/educacion/innova/secundaria-tecnica/proyecto-piazzolla).  
On another side, I'm a music lover, mainly classical music like Bach and some Indie rock.
